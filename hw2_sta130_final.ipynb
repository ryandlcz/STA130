    "word_used: Tracks how many times each word appears in the input text.\n",
    "next_word: Tracks which words follow each word, along with the frequency of these transitions.\n",

This foundational structure is based on a Markov chain model, where the likelihood of a word being chosen depends on how frequently it follows the previous word in the text."
