    "This conversation explored the interpretation of statistical symbols, the concept of the null hypothesis, and the role of p-values in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "●\n",
    "You initially sought to confirm your understanding of the symbols x_i, xbar, μ, and μ0 within the context of an example involving head tilt direction in kissing couples. You correctly identified x_i as the individual head tilt direction for each couple and μ0 as the hypothesized population mean under the null hypothesis (50% in this case, representing no preference).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "●\n",
    "However, you needed clarification on xbar and μ. You learned that xbar represents the sample proportion of right-tilting couples, calculated by dividing the number of right-tilting couples by the total sample size, not by dividing x_i by the quantity of x_i. Similarly, μ represents the true proportion of right-tilting couples in the entire population, encompassing all kissing couples, not just those with a rightward tilt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "●\n",
    "You then asked about the definitive nature of p-values in proving or disproving the null hypothesis. The conversation clarified that no specific p-value can definitively prove or disprove a null hypothesis. Instead, p-values should be interpreted as indicators of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "●\n",
    "Smaller p-values suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, but even a very small p-value doesn't eliminate the possibility that the null hypothesis is true and the results are due to chance. Conversely, a large p-value doesn't prove the null hypothesis; it just means the data isn't unusual enough to provide strong evidence against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "●\n",
    "The conversation emphasized that while a p-value less than 0.05 is often considered \"statistically significant\", this doesn't equate to certainty. It simply signifies moderate to strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "●\n",
    "Finally, you requested the 'Demo II' code from TUT05. While the sources don't explicitly provide this code, they indicate that 'Demo II' likely involved using simulation to perform a hypothesis test and calculate a p-value, possibly using the \"Vaccine Data Analysis Assignment\" from Week 04 or the \"Stella's Wheel of Destiny\" example.\n"

    "Below, we shall conduct a hypothesis test based on Fisher's Tea Experiment with students in STA130. Fisher's Tea Experiment was conducted with 8 cups of tea, 4 of which had milk poured before the tea, and the other 4 had milk poured after the tea. The test subject had to correctly identify which cups of tea had milk before the tea, and which cups had milk poured after the tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **parameter of interest for this test will be the true proportion *p* of correct guesses in the population of students**, or the probability that a student guesses correctly. For our purposes, our **sample will be comprised of 80 STA130 students**, who will each taste just a single cup of tea and guess whether they think milk or tea was poured first. Of these 80 students, 49/80 correctly identified which cups of tea had milk poured before and which had milk poured after. \n",

    "We will use this **observed test statistic (49/80)** to make inferences of our **population, which will be the entirety of STA130 students**, by comparing it against the distribution of simulated test statistics. From this, we will calculate a p-value, which tells us the extremities of the observed number of correct guesses compared to what one would expect to arise out of sheer luck. From this p-value, we can infer whether the evidence we have collected is strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which would suggest that students can in fact tell the difference between which beverage was poured first.\n",

    "Since we are only testing for whether *p* is greater than 0.5 (students guessing correctly more often than not), we will run a one-sided-test. This one-sided test will return a p-value which will help us determine whether we can reject the null hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is our code which will simulate our test 10000 times with a 50% chance of being correct over a sample size of 80. The p-value will then be calculated by the proportion of simulated results that are as extreme or more than our observed test statistic (49/80). If our p-value is less than our chosen α value of 0.05, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypotheses."
